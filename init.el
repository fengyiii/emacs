;; This file bootstraps the configuration, which is divided into
;; a number of other files.

;;; Code:

(let ((minver "26.1"))
  (when (version< emacs-version minver)
    (error "Your Emacs is too old -- this config requires v%s or higher" minver)))
(when (version< emacs-version "27.1")
  (message "Your Emacs is old, and some functionality in this config will be disabled. Please upgrade if possible."))

(add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "lisp" user-emacs-directory))
;; (require 'init-benchmarking) ;; Measure startup time

(defconst *spell-check-support-enabled* nil) ;; Enable with t if you prefer
(defconst *is-a-mac* (eq system-type 'darwin))

;; Adjust garbage collection thresholds during startup, and thereafter

(let ((normal-gc-cons-threshold (* 20 1024 1024))
